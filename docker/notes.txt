Exporting run loses R1 and R2 files... how do we fix this?

I need an easy way to add new parameters into this whole system.

Standardize what I get back on result fetching, pointers to files or contents of files???
  I saw with qc i get the HTML in the response, but on cutadapt i get pointers to files

We need to make sure that the pipeline works as intended. If we run fastp, are we using fastps raw data now or not?
What if the user decides not to run fastp, what are we using then? We need to go over all of this again with Miro
Is readlen supposed to use the output of cutadapt even if fastp was run?
  Cutadapt + fastp > cutadapt > fastp > rawdata
  we need to check if these steps ran in the DB AND the files actually exist. So beware of run cleaning as this can cause errors here.

Current step and status is misleading and confusing at times. 
After 'running' it should go back to pending if completed. If failed, the status of the whole run should be failed.
There should also be a 'not started' status
All of these statuses should be in the run statuses constants (cleaned is for sure not!)
also validate_run_status and validate_job_status are NEVER used...

download_genome_if_needed is a bit messy currently, clean this up. it should use has_bwa_mem2_index and this can then directly be used in start_read_mapping

job_utils run_command_sync is useless, never used...

we have a couple too many 'system' endpoints that do more or less the same... redesign this a little bit

FASTP.json and FASTP.html NOT IN RUN DIRECTORY RESULTS?!??!

We need to also do some more automated E2E/ unhappy path testing and validation...

Perhaps also some unit tests...
