  Kills a specific job by its job ID.

  Unlike "Kill Run Jobs" which kills all jobs for a run, this targets
  a single job. Useful when you know the exact job_id from a status
  check or run details response.

  Prerequisites:
  - Replace the job ID (1) in the URL with your actual job ID (integer)
  - Get job IDs from "Get Run Details" or "Get Step Status" responses

  Expected response: 200 OK
  {
    "message": "Job <job_id> killed successfully",
    "job_id": 123,
    "run_id": "uuid-of-parent-run"
  }

  If the job is not currently running, the kill may have no effect
  (job already completed or failed).
