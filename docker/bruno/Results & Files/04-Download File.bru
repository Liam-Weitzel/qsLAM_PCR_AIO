  Downloads a specific file from the run workspace.

  The path after /files/ is relative to the run directory. Change the URL
  path to download different files. Common examples:
  - readlen/readlen.pdf (read length distribution plot)
  - bwa/aligned.sorted.bam (aligned reads)
  - bwa/aligned.sorted.bam.flagstat (alignment statistics)
  - bed2peak/annotated_peaks.xlsx (annotated peak results)
  - fastqc/beforeCutAdapt/R1_fastqc.html (FastQC report)
  - logs/cutadapt.log (step log file)

  Prerequisites:
  - Run must exist
  - The target file must exist (run the relevant pipeline step first)
  - Set run_id environment variable to the target run

  Expected response: File download (binary content).
  The Content-Disposition header will contain the filename.

  Tip: Use "List Run Files" first to see available files and their paths.
